## My Portofolio using HTML and CSS

## Start

The following document will take you through the tough process and initative of this project. 

This project was made with the motivation and vision in mind of creating a portofolio to showcase my current skills as a front end developer.

I would like to shout out to my tutor John Titus who helped me to create the flex box as I previously used a grid that was not aestetically pleasing.

## End

The portofolio is a prototype which will be modified as time comes with new and fun projects and other accomplishments.
